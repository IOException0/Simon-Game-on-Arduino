The Classic Simon Game is implemented on the Arduino.

Select between three games!
  1. Simon Says. (Different levels of difficulty)
  2. Player Says.
  3. Add the color. (Multiplayer)
7-Segment display for the score.
Speaker for tones.

This video demonstrates how the game works. https://youtu.be/ujJS4dphBKc

Currently, the game is prototyped on the breadboard.
Soon I'll add the schematic and gerber files.

Thank You.
